{"id":"agent-shepherd-7gt","title":"Agent Shepherd Installation \u0026 Distribution Refactor","description":"Refactor Agent Shepherd's installation and distribution system to support hybrid installations, cross-platform compatibility, and user-friendly installer scripts. This includes creating installer scripts for macOS/Linux and Windows, adding update/version commands, and implementing README symlink for GitHub visibility.","design":"Agent Shepherd - Installation \u0026 Distribution Refactor\nSession Summary\nThe Problem\nAgent Shepherd lives in .agent-shepherd/ by design - when installed in user projects, it should be a clean, self-contained dotfolder that doesn't pollute the user's repo. However, this creates a GitHub visibility problem: the README at .agent-shepherd/README.md is hidden because GitHub only shows READMEs at the repository root.\nWe explored several solutions:\n- Moving everything to repo root (rejected - would conflict with user's files when installed)\n- Two separate repos (rejected - unnecessary complexity)\n- Symlink + smart installer (chosen solution)\nThe Solution\n1. Symlink for GitHub visibility: Create README.md at repo root as a symlink to .agent-shepherd/README.md. GitHub renders symlinked READMEs, so visitors see the full documentation. The symlink is only in the development repo - users never get it.\n2. Smart installer: Instead of users cloning the whole repo, they run an installer script that copies ONLY .agent-shepherd/ to their project. This means:\n   - Users get a clean installation (just the dotfolder)\n   - No README conflict with their own project\n   - No dev files (openspec/, .beads/, etc.) polluting their repo\n3. Hybrid installation model: Users choose between:\n   - Hybrid: Binary in ~/.agent-shepherd/, config per-project in ./.agent-shepherd/config/\n   - Local: Everything self-contained in ./.agent-shepherd/\n4. Command linking options: Users choose whether to:\n   - Global link: ashep command available everywhere (convenient, single version)\n   - No link: Run via bunx ashep or explicit path (supports multiple versions)\n5. Versioning via GitHub releases: Tags like v1.0.0 enable:\n   - Installing specific versions\n   - ashep update / ashep update v1.2.0 for upgrades/downgrades\n   - Version tracking in ~/.agent-shepherd/VERSION\n6. Cross-platform support: Two installers (bash + PowerShell) plus fixes to the codebase to replace Unix-specific commands with Node APIs.\nWhy This Approach?\n| Decision | Why |\n|----------|-----|\n| Symlink README | Single source of truth, visible on GitHub, not shipped to users |\n| Installer script | Users get only what they need, clean project |\n| Hybrid option | Shared binary saves disk space, per-project config makes sense |\n| Local option | Self-contained projects that work when cloned |\n| Dual installers | Windows and macOS/Linux have different shells |\n| ashep update | Easy maintenance, version pinning for stability |\nCurrent Windows Compatibility Issues\nThe codebase has Unix-specific commands that break on Windows:\n- cp -r → needs fs.cpSync()\n- rm -rf → needs fs.rmSync()\n- $HOME → needs os.homedir()\n- curl | bash for Beads install → needs OS detection\n---\nImplementation Plan\nPhase 1: Cross-Platform Fixes\nGoal: Make current code work on Windows\nFile: .agent-shepherd/src/cli/index.ts\n1. Add imports:\nimport { cpSync, rmSync } from \"fs\";\nimport { homedir, platform } from \"os\";\n2.

{"id":"agent-shepherd-uj0","title":"Agent Shepherd Fallback Agent System Implementation","description":"Problem Statement\nWhen running ashep quickstart, validation fails because policies require capabilities (testing, qa, review, architecture) that don't exist in synced OpenCode agents. This prevents new users from getting started immediately.\n\nSolution: Cascading Fallback Agent Hierarchy\nA three-tier fallback system that allows capabilities to map to existing real agents in OpenCode:\nPhase-Level (specific) → Policy-Level (policy-wide) → Global-Level (system-wide)\n\nKey concept: When a policy requires a capability that no agent has, the system falls back to a specified agent (e.g., build) to handle the task anyway.\n\nDesign Decisions Confirmed\n1. Configuration Structure\nconfig.yaml (Global Level):\nfallback:\n  enabled: true              # Master switch - if false, NO fallback anywhere\n  default_agent: build       # Default fallback agent for all capabilities\n  mappings:                 # Optional: global capability-specific mappings\n    review: summary\n    documentation: summary\n    architecture: plan\n\npolicies.yaml (Policy and Phase Levels):\npolicies:\n  simple:\n    fallback_enabled: true        # Inherits from global if not set\n    fallback_agent: build        # Inherits from global if not set\n    fallback_mappings:           # Optional: policy-specific mappings\n      review: summary\n    phases:\n      - name: test\n        capabilities: [testing]\n        # Phase-level override:\n        fallback_agent: general\n        # OR disable for this phase:\n        fallback_enabled: false\n\n2. Hierarchy Rules\n- Cascading: Phase-level overrides Policy-level overrides Global-level\n- Default inheritance: If a level doesn't specify settings, inherit from higher level\n- Disable: If fallback_enabled: false at any level, fallback is disabled for that level\n- Master switch: If config.fallback.enabled: false, NO fallback anywhere\n\n3. Mappings Explained\nmappings allows capability-specific fallback agents:\n- Without mappings: All missing capabilities use default_agent: build\n- With mappings: Specific capabilities use different agents:\n  - review: summary → Review tasks handled by summary agent\n  - architecture: plan → Architecture tasks handled by plan agent\n  - Everything else → Falls back to build\nWhy mappings?\n- Better agent matching for different work types\n- summary agent is better at review/documentation than build agent\n- plan agent is better at architecture than build agent\n- Still provides default fallback for anything else\n\n4. Confirmed Defaults\n- Default fallback agent: build (has: coding, refactoring, building)\n- Default enabled state: true (turned on for both config and policies)\n- Default mappings: Keep simple initially - only default_agent: build (users can add mappings later)\n- Backward compatibility: Treat as disabled if config doesn't have fallback fields\n\n5. Runtime Behavior\nAgent Selection Logic:\nfunction selectAgent(capability, policy, phase) {\n  // 1. Try to find agent with capability\n  let agent = getAgentsByCapability(capability);\n  \n  if (!agent) {\n    // 2. No agent has capability - use fallback\n    agent = getFallbackAgent(capability, policy, phase);\n    \n    if (agent) {\n      logger.info(`ℹ️ Using fallback agent '${agent.name}' for capability '${capability}'`);\n    }\n  }\n  \n  return agent;\n}\n\nfunction getFallbackAgent(capability, policy, phase) {\n  // Check cascading hierarchy:\n  // 1. Phase-level override?\n  if (phase.fallback_agent) return getAgent(phase.fallback_agent);\n  \n  // 2. Phase disabled?\n  if (phase.fallback_enabled === false) return null;\n  \n  // 3. Policy mappings?\n  if (policy.fallback_mappings?.[capability]) return getAgent(policy.fallback_mappings[capability]);\n  \n  // 4. Policy disabled?\n  if (policy.fallback_enabled === false) return null;\n  \n  // 5. Global mappings?\n  if (config.fallback?.mappings?.[capability]) return getAgent(config.fallback.mappings[capability]);\n  \n  // 6. Global disabled?\n  if (!config.fallback?.enabled) return null;\n  \n  // 7. Use policy or global default_agent\n  const fallbackId = policy.fallback_agent || config.fallback?.default_agent;\n  return fallbackId ? getAgent(fallbackId) : null;\n}\n\n6. Validation Updates\nValidator must:\n1. Check if fallback agents exist in OpenCode for all 3 levels\n2. Verify fallback agents are active\n3. Show info messages about which capabilities will use fallback\n4. Error if fallback enabled but agent doesn't exist or is inactive\n5. Pass validation when fallback covers missing capabilities\n\nExample validation output:\n✅ Main configuration: Valid\n✅ Policy definitions: Valid\n✅ Agent registry: Valid\nℹ️  Policy chain validation: Using fallback for 2 capabilities\n   • policies.yaml: default.test: Capability 'testing' handled by fallback agent 'Build Agent'\n   • policies.yaml: default.review: Capability 'review' handled by fallback agent 'Summary Agent'\n✅ Policy chain validation: Valid\n\nImplementation Plan\nPhase 1: Schema Updates\n1. Update config.schema.json:\n   - Add fallback object schema\n   - Include enabled (boolean), default_agent (string), mappings (object)\n   - Mark as optional for backward compatibility\n2. Update policies.schema.json:\n   - Add fallback_enabled (boolean, optional) to policy level\n   - Add fallback_agent (string, optional) to policy level\n   - Add fallback_mappings (object, optional) to policy level\n   - Add fallback_agent (string, optional) to phase level\n   - Add fallback_enabled (boolean, optional) to phase level\n\nPhase 2: Configuration Loading\n3. Update config.ts:\n   - Load and parse fallback section from config.yaml\n   - Provide default values (enabled: false, no mappings) if not present\n4. Update policy.ts:\n   - Parse fallback fields when loading policies\n   - Handle inheritance logic (policy inherits from global if not set)\n\nPhase 3: Validation\n5. Update policy-capability-validator.ts:\n   - Modify validateCapability() to check fallback hierarchy\n   - Add new validation function validateFallbackAgent()\n   - Update error messages to include fallback information\n   - Change severity: missing capability with valid fallback = info/warning (not error)\n   - Add error type for invalid fallback config (agent doesn't exist or inactive)\n\nPhase 4: Runtime Selection\n6. Update agent-registry.ts:\n   - Add getFallbackAgent(capability, policy, phase) function\n   - Integrate with selectAgent() to use fallback when needed\n   - Add logging when fallback is used\n\nPhase 5: CLI Updates\n7. Update cmdInit() in cli/index.ts:\n   - Add fallback section to default config.yaml:\n          fallback:\n       enabled: true\n       default_agent: build\n     \n8. Update cmdQuickstart() in cli/index.ts:\n   - Add explanation about fallback system\n   - Show which capabilities are using fallback\n   - Make it clear this is normal for first-time setup\n9. Update validation output in cmdValidatePolicyChain():\n   - Show fallback info clearly\n   - Distinguish between critical errors (no agent, no fallback) and fallback usage\n\nPhase 6: Documentation\n10. Update README.md:\n    - Add section explaining fallback system\n    - Include configuration examples\n    - Explain when and why to use fallback\n11. Update docs/config-config.md:\n    - Document fallback configuration section\n    - Provide examples of global and policy-level mappings\n    - Explain master switch behavior\n12. Update docs/policies-config.md:\n    - Document fallback fields at policy and phase level\n    - Show cascading hierarchy examples\n    - Explain disable functionality\n13. Update docs/architecture.md (if applicable):\n    - Explain fallback system in architecture overview\n    - Add fallback to workflow diagrams\n\nTesting Checklist\n- [ ] Schema validation accepts fallback configurations\n- [ ] Fallback disabled when not present in config (backward compatibility)\n- [ ] Global fallback works for all missing capabilities\n- [ ] Policy-level fallback overrides global\n- [ ] Phase-level fallback overrides policy and global\n- [ ] fallback_enabled: false disables fallback at that level\n- [ ] config.fallback.enabled: false disables all fallbacks\n- [ ] Validation passes when fallback covers missing capabilities\n- [ ] Validation errors when fallback agent doesn't exist\n- [ ] Validation errors when fallback agent is inactive\n- [ ] Runtime uses fallback agent when capability missing\n- [ ] Runtime logs when fallback is used\n- [ ] Mappings route capabilities to correct agents\n- [ ] Default configuration creates working system after quickstart\n\nFiles to Modify\n- .agent-shepherd/schemas/config.schema.json\n- .agent-shepherd/schemas/policies.schema.json\n- .agent-shepherd/src/core/config.ts\n- .agent-shepherd/src/core/policy.ts\n- .agent-shepherd/src/core/agent-registry.ts\n- .agent-shepherd/src/core/policy-capability-validator.ts\n- .agent-shepherd/src/core/policy-tree-visualizer.ts (may need updates to show fallback)\n- .agent-shepherd/src/cli/index.ts\n- .agent-shepherd/README.md\n- .agent-shepherd/docs/config-config.md\n- .agent-shepherd/docs/policies-config.md\n\nCurrent State\n- Problem: Validation fails in ashep quickstart due to missing capabilities\n- Solution: Cascading fallback agent system confirmed\n- All design decisions finalized and agreed upon\n- Ready to begin implementation","status":"open","priority":1,"issue_type":"epic","created_at":"2026-01-05T02:41:26.628174+01:00","updated_at":"2026-01-05T02:41:26.628174+01:00"}

Add new section \"Fallback Agent Configuration\" in the policies documentation\n\n2. Document policy-level fallback fields:\n   - fallback_enabled (boolean, optional): Enable/disable for this policy\n   - fallback_agent (string, optional): Fallback agent for this policy\n   - fallback_mappings (object, optional): Capability-specific mappings\n\n3. Document phase-level fallback fields:\n   - fallback_agent (string, optional): Override fallback agent for this phase\n   - fallback_enabled (boolean, optional): Disable fallback for this phase\n\n4. Provide cascading hierarchy examples:\n\nExample 1: Policy Override Global\n```yaml\n# config.yaml\nfallback:\n  enabled: true\n  default_agent: build\n\n# policies.yaml\npolicies:\n  my-policy:\n    fallback_enabled: true\n    fallback_agent: summary  # Override global default\n```\n\nExample 2: Phase Override Policy\n```yaml\npolicies:\n  my-policy:\n    fallback_enabled: true\n    fallback_agent: summary\n    phases:\n      - name: test\n        capabilities: [testing]\n        fallback_agent: general  # Override policy default\n```\n\nExample 3: Disable Fallback at Phase Level\n```yaml\npolicies:\n  my-policy:\n    fallback_enabled: true\n    fallback_agent: summary\n    phases:\n      - name: review\n        capabilities: [review]\n        fallback_enabled: false  # No fallback for this phase\n```\n\n5. Explain disable functionality:\n   - fallback_enabled: false at any level disables fallback\n   - Cascading: Phase disables → No fallback for this phase\n   - Cascading: Policy disables → No fallback for any phase in this policy\n   - Cascading: Global disables → No fallback anywhere\n\n6. Add inheritance rules:\n   - If not specified, inherit from parent level\n   - Explicit false always disables\n   - Explicit value always overrides inheritance\n\nAcceptance Criteria:\n- [ ] Fallback section added to policies documentation\n- [ ] Policy-level fields documented\n- [ ] Phase-level fields documented\n- [ ] Cascading hierarchy examples provided\n- [ ] Disable functionality explained clearly\n- [ ] Inheritance rules documented\n- [ ] Examples are clear and well-commented\n- [ ] Documentation is comprehensive","status":"closed","priority":3,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2026-01-05T02:44:34.419129+01:00","updated_at":"2026-01-05T03:23:47.512091+01:00","closed_at":"2026-01-05T03:23:47.512091+01:00","close_reason":"Completed","dependencies":[{"issue_id":"agent-shepherd-ybi","depends_on_id":"agent-shepherd-uj0","type":"parent-child","created_at":"2026-01-05T02:45:00.599749+01:00","created_by":"daemon"}]}
